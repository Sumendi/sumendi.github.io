og_description: "We\'re still preparing the summary of our last edition but we know you're impatient beasts – all we humans are, right? – so in the meantime, we have the pleasure to present you, in all their vertical cinemascopesque glory, the nice timelapses of #sumendi3. Enjoy!"
#og_description: "This was another fantastic edition. We had some timing issues with the first service –we are deeply sorry for them, dear friends!– but the feedback of our lovely guests has been great and we are again honored to count with their support for making Sumendi a reality."
