          You know what chefs really want to do? They don't want Michelin stars, critics and customers praising them… those are always nice if they come, but it's not the deep wish hidden in chefs' heart.
          What they –yes, all of them– really want to do is to go to the market in the morning, check all the great things that the farmers have brought and buy the fresher, most beautiful stuff available. Then go to their small place –15, 20 seats top– <span style="color: #818B92">fill it with friends and cook</span>. No menus. No plate's cost analysis. No picky diners. No upselling.
        </h5>
        <h5 style="color: #ffffff;">
          Jesus… just cook. And then laughs, people smiling as they eat, friendship, high spirits (both liquid and mystic) and life spurting forcefully and spilled over the table.
        </h5>
        <h5 style="color: #ffffff;">
          With Sumendi we are really very close to that dream. Cooking for friends <span style="color: #818B92">makes us free</span>. We're free to make the menu we'd love to eat. <span style="color: #818B92">Free to play</span>. Free to work in the menu for longer than most restaurants do. Free to do it in –absolutely not profitable but– meaningful ways. Free to enjoy the experience as much as the diners do.
        </h5>
        <h5 style="color: #ffffff;">
          We go all in. Fresh flowers in the table and the toilets? That's a must. Homemade brioche? You betcha. <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Amuse-bouche">Amuse-bouche</a> like the great restaurants? Count with it.  For Christ's sake, our napkins are handmade by… ourselves!
