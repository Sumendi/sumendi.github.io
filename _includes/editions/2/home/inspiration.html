              The weather in Iceland is not as bad as most people think –actually it's far better than other allegedly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland#cite_ref-12">greener pastures</a>– but it's true that the year only counts with two seasons: Winter and Summer.

            <h4 class="margin-30" style="color: #ffffff;">
              And that has been the main inspiration for our menu. We'll be swinging back and forth between the two seasons… saying goodbye to the heavy, rich courses of the winter and greeting the refreshing, colorful plates of summer.

               Icelandic –as basque– is a language where word-building has been used intensively with beautiful and poetic results. Not surprisingly it is <a href="http://www.everysinglewordinicelandic.com/">full of amazing words</a> and between them, the perfect one for this edition: <strong>Árstíðaskipti</strong> literally meaning "change of seasons".
