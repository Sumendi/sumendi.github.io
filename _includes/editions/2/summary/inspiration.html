                The weather in Iceland is not as bad as most people think –actually it's far better than other allegedly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland#cite_ref-12">greener pastures</a>– but it's true that the year only counts with two seasons: Winter and Summer.

              <h4 class="margin-30">

                 Icelandic –as basque– is a language where word-building has been used intensively with beautiful and poetic results. Not surprisingly it is <a href="http://www.everysinglewordinicelandic.com/">full of amazing words</a> and between them, the perfect one for this edition: <strong>Árstíðaskipti</strong> literally meaning "change of seasons".
