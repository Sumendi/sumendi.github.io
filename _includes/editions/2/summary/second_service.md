              As a consequence of limiting the guests to just two services we think the 9pm service was much smoother and just better than in the previous edition.

              Again a great mix of new and repeating customers. The amazings David and Arna honoured us with their presence, as icelandic friends as Trausti did, but we were lucky enough have new awesome guests coming from all parts of the planet: <strong>Canada, Portugal, Sweden, Thailand, USA, Ukraine…</strong>.

              One of the things we learnt reading <a href="http://www.phaidon.com/store/food-cook/a-day-at-elbulli-9780714848839/">A Day at elBulli</a> is that Ferran Adrià will always destinate 50% of the total available number of seats for a season to new customers, (leaving the other 50% for repeating customers). Now we understand why… it really opens up the experience for everybody.

              This time we think the flow of the long menu was much better in this service. Actually, we were able to go to the dining room for finishing both desserts in front of our guests and had the satisfaction of seeing them enjoying these two final courses.

              Another up-and-coming tradition is the final off-the-menu shot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patxaran">Patxaran</a> we offer to our guests. This time the announcement of what we think is the best Patxaran in the world –<a href="http://www.pacharan.com/">Baines</a>– was received by a tremendous cheer! If getting some people converted into patxaran fans were the only thing to come out of Sumendi, we'll be perfectly happy.
            </p>
            <p><strong>We couldn't be more happy with the service and the whole edition!</strong></p>
