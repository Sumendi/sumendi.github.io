              This time we decided to do only two services. The reason is that <a href="/editions/1">in the previous edition</a> we were forced to basically "kick out" the 6pm service to start preparing and setting the table the 9pm service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Luckily there were a lot of friends in that service that were very understanding with the situation, but it was definitely <strong>not the kind of thing</strong> we wanted to repeat.

              Bego was in charge of the dining room during the whole day and as she was introducing and <strong>explaining each one of the plates and their history</strong>, she found time to answer the general questions that our guests had about our the basque culture.

              We were very lucky again, and we had incredibly nice guests again. Luciano (and his companion) and Xavier are becoming regulars of Sumendi (something we are really grateful for) and we added two new amazing icelanders: <strong>Sígriður</strong> and <strong>Svanhildur</strong>.
            </p>

              Another detail that is becoming a tradition at Sumendi is the service's timelapse. We set up a camera recording pictures every few seconds, generating in the end a timelapse like the one you can see next to this paragraph: a <strong>four minutes fast summary of what is to eat at Sumendi</strong>.
