          We are sea people. The first contact between our two nations was the direct consequence of fishing activities. Basques were hunting whales and catching cod in Icelandic waters as early as 1610. With time we started to understand each other better and even created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque-Icelandic_pidgin" style="text-decoration: underline; color:#303440;">a shared pidgin</a>. There were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A1nverjav%C3%ADgin" style="text-decoration: underline; color:#303440;">some bumps on the road</a> but, hey, no hard feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basques worship cod and have made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Basque_people#Basque_sailors" style="text-decoration: underline; color:#303440;">long journeys</a> to catch it. We learned from nordic visitors how to dry fish and we teached them how to salt it, using the same techniques we were using already for salting whale's tongue. Icelanders love too this fish and it has been one so economically and culturally important that it was portrayed on <a href="http://eng.forsaetisraduneyti.is/state-symbols/icelandic-coat-of-arms/history#Cod_emblem" style="text-decoration: underline; color:#303440;">their coat of arms</a> for centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          To celebrate this shared passion, we chose two of the most popular cod recipes in the Basque Country: Pil-pil and Bizkaina. First one is an alchemic trick made possible by the incredible gelatins contained in the cod. The fish is cooked at low temperature (60 Â°C) in an extra virgin olive oil confit that has been previously infusionated with garlic. As the cod is releasing its precious content into the oil, the pot is frecuenly moved creating an beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion" style="text-decoration: underline; color:#303440;">emulsion</a> of a bright green color that, as one of our guests said, "is the pure essence of the cod".
        </p>
        <p>
          Second one is firmly rooted in the unique flavor of the <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fes.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPimiento_choricero" style="text-decoration: underline; color:#303440;">choricero peppers</a>, a special type of peppers dried on strings. At many houses in the Basque Country you can see long strings of these choricero peppers hanging up on the balconies. They are usually rehydrated in warm water and used as a base in the creation of this tasty sauce.
        </p>

          Some weed strips (icelandic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp" style="text-decoration: underline; color:#303440;">Kelp</a>) and a few drops of Persil oil were used to finish this plate that I think is a great representation of one the strongest ties between icelandic and basque culture: cod.
