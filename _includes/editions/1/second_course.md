          Stews, roasted and grilled portions of lamb meat from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latxa">Latxa</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basco-B%C3%A9arnais">Carranzana</a> breeds (native to the Basque Country) and their crosses, had long been a permanent staple of the Basque diet.

          Specially apreciated are the lambs known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_and_mutton#Classifications_and_nomenclature">milk-fed lambs</a>. They must be slaughtered at an age of between 21 and 35 days. These lambs are fed only with maternal milk, reared in a natural environment, and slaughtered when they have a dressed weight (with head and innards) of between 5-8 kg, which results in tender succulent meat with a pearly white to pink color.

          Icelanders have had a long standing relationship with their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_sheep">lambs</a> too. In fact, <a href="http://icelandreview.com/icelandreview/search/news/Default.asp?ew_0_a_id=292113">r√©ttir</a>, the annual round-up happenning every fall, where farmers summon a team of shepherds and ride into the mountains to collect their sheep, is still one of the most important events in countryside Iceland.

        <p>We're deeply proud of being part of two cultures that have known how to protect the local breeds for centuries, incorporating them in the culture and social habits and giving them the respect they deserve. And to celebrate that fact and let the superb quality of the icelandic lamb shine, we picked this simple recipe as one of the main courses.</p>

          We started by warming up a pan to the right temperature to give give the fillets a fast, perfect sear. Then the heat was deepened with a few minutes in the hot oven. When you work with great materials is easy to have a great results: fresh leek sprouts, great potatoes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piquillo_pepper">piquillo peppers</a> sauce for the setup and Icelandic Lamb Fille roasted on its own grease.
