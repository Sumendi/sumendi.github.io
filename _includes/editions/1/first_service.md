        <p>
          We knew that first service should be smaller than the others so the staff can detect all the small problems and make the experience as smooth as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we didn't know is that we'd have the inmense luck to fill the service with people as nice as <strong>Miguel Angel</strong> (a professional chef from Basque Country, woot!) <strong>Luciano</strong>, <strong>Xavier</strong> and <strong>Lorena</strong>. It really felt like a lunch with friends.
        </p>
        <p>Everything went very well with the only exception of the Pil-Pil, due to my miscalculation on the proportions for such a small service, but they had the deference to not even mention the issue. Thanks guys!</p>
