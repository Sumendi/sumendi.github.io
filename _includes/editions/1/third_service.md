        <p>
          The final round. The moment of truth. There is an old saying among chefs: "You are only as good as your last service".
        </p>
        <p>
          Best chefs in the world are usually recognized by their innovation creating new flavours, textures and techniques. Some of our heroes —<a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eneko_Atxa">Eneko Atxa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart%C3%ADn_Berasategui">Martin Berasategui</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Mari_Arzak">Juan Mari Arzak</a>,  <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andoni_Luis_Aduriz">Andoni Aduriz</a>— are year after year in the top lists of the best restaurants in the world, creating dozens of new recipes. But one key factor of their success that goes unnoticed too often is their consistency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, it's very difficult to keep innovating constantly but we think that very definition of professionalism —and its main difference with respect to amateurs— is connected with this less fancy concept of consistency.

            A gastronomical cathedral like <a href="http://www.azurmendi.biz/?idioma=en">Azurmendi</a> will not only create very complex marvels like this <a href="http://www.weine-feinkost.de/unterwegs/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/azurmendi_9.jpg">Oxtail's ravioli</a> but will serve it to 200 people per night with exactly the same quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            And we know that is incredibly difficult. In this last service, we struggled in the kitchen to finish the dessert for 15 guests and they waited for more that we'd like to admit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately it was at the end of the dinner and all our guests were incredibly nice people that being many of them unknown to each other, had a very good time chatting and eating together for a night.
          </p>
          <p>What could be better than that? To be an invisible enabler that helps to create memories &amp; happyness. That is what we wanted Sumendi to be… and we got it. <span class="highlight-text">Thanks everybody for making it possible.</span></p>
