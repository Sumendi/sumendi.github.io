              Another service packed with new and old friens: <a href="http://waterpigs.co.uk/">Barnaby</a>, <a href="http://borgarmynd.com/">Snorri</a>, <a href="http://www.the-disorganization.com/">Valgeir</a>, <a href="http://suda.co.uk/">Brian</a>, Ninja, Alda &amp; Sigurlaug and her respective companions honored us attending Sumendi's second service.

              Bego was in charge of the dining room during the whole day and as she was introducing and <strong>explaining each one of the plates and their history</strong>, she found time to answer the general questions that our guests had about our the basque culture.

              We wanted to make the experience as complete as possible and as visual complement to the food, we projected a <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/_aitor/sumendi-edition-number-1">collection of historical and recent images</a> of the Basque Country and Iceland in one of the room's walls. Once again we were surprised by the similarites between our two nations.

              During the three services a camera was recording the pictures every few seconds. With all these pictures we have made <span class="highlight-text">one timelapse for each service</span> —like the one you can see next to this paragraph— in a few minutes a summary of a 2-3 hours experience. It's not like being in Sumendi but we think is a good way to glimpse the general mood.

              This was one of the most relaxing services of the day. The size (9 guests) made it <strong>perfect to keep a nice pace</strong>, get the feedback and comments from the guests and have time to enjoy the cooking in the kitchen and the food in the dining room. Thanks everybody!
