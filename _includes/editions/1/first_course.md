        <p>
          This is a plate that has been a permanent fixture in the diets of modest peasants, farmers and workers for centuries. Garlic was —and is still today— despised as a low-class ingredient and we can find written references of this contempt that go as far as 1615, to one of the most universal books, The History of Don Quixote:

          There are infinite recipes of Garlic Soup, but tradionally most of them involve thick chunks of bread floating in a garlic infusionated chicken broth. That is actually the <a href="http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=sopa" style="text-decoration: underline; color:#303440;">canonical definition of soup</a> in spanish: "Piece of bread soaked in any liquid". However we know that many people don't like the soggy texture the bread gets if it's soaked for too long.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prevent that, we triturated the usual garlic soup recipe and set a few pieces of the best freshly toasted bread from <a href="http://www.sandholt.is/" style="text-decoration: underline; color:#303440;">Sandholt</a> in the bottom of the plate, covering them with two nice icelandic lobster tails —a very icelandic ingredient— and radish sprouts from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ecospira" style="text-decoration: underline; color:#303440;">Ecospira</a>, a small company in Hafnarfjörður focused in creating high quality sprouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the plate was delivered to the dining room and the soup was served in front of the customer. And, in the most Pythonesque tradition, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enSYlCEz5VI" style="text-decoration: underline; color:#303440;">there was much rejoicing</a>.
